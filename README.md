## MULTIMODAL EMOTION ANALYSIS FOR PRAGMATIC INTERPRETATION OF WORDS IN CONTEXT
<div align="center">
<p align="justify">
When people communicate with each other, often, what is said and what is meant
do not coincide; it is normal for a person to infer the meaning behind incomplete
utterances, rhetorical figures, implicatures, and other non-direct ways of verbal communication. It is easy for a person to ”read the room” or ”read between lines” during a conversation or, in general, in the course of social interaction, but why is it so, and which mechanisms allow implicatures in non-explicit contexts? This thesis aims at building a system able to integrate different sources of information and derive the correct interpretation of an utterance in non-trivial circumstances, such as the case of an interaction that comprehends irony or other figures of speech. We will explore the role of emotions in pragmatic reasoning and how much and in which way they contribute to the communicative act.
